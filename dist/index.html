          France, officially French Republic, French France or République
          Française, country of northwestern Europe. Historically and culturally
          among the most important nations in the Western world, France has also
          played a highly significant role in international affairs, with former
          colonies in every corner of the globe. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean
          and the Mediterranean Sea, the Alps and the Pyrenees, France has long
          provided a geographic, economic, and linguistic bridge joining
          northern and southern Europe. It is Europe’s most important
          agricultural producer and one of the world’s leading industrial
          powers."

          The graph shows the groups of men of different age (20 to 79 years) of
          French nationality. The table shows basic information about the 10
          oldest males from the available data. 1000 records from external API
          were used.

          The French are, paradoxically, strongly conscious of belonging to a
          single nation, but they hardly constitute a unified ethnic group by
          any scientific gauge. Before the official discovery of the Americas at
          the end of the 15th century, France, located on the western extremity
          of the Old World, was regarded for centuries by Europeans as being
          near the edge of the known world. Generations of different migrants
          traveling by way of the Mediterranean from the Middle East and Africa
          and through Europe from Central Asia and the Nordic lands settled
          permanently in France, forming a variegated grouping, almost like a
          series of geologic strata, since they were unable to migrate any
          farther. Perhaps the oldest reflection of these migrations is
          furnished by the Basque people, who live in an isolated area west of
          the Pyrenees in both Spain and France, who speak a language unrelated
          to other European languages, and whose origin remains unclear. The
          Celtic tribes, known to the Romans as Gauls, spread from central
          Europe in the period 500 BCE–500 CE to provide France with a major
          component of its population, especially in the centre and west. At the
          fall of the Roman Empire, there was a powerful penetration of Germanic
          (Teutonic) peoples, especially in northern and eastern France. The
          incursion of the Norsemen (Vikings) brought further Germanic
          influence. In addition to these many migrations, France was, over the
          centuries, the field of numerous battles and of prolonged occupations
          before becoming, in the 19th and especially in the 20th century, the
          prime recipient of foreign immigration into Europe, adding still other
          mixtures to the ethnic melting pot.

          French is the national language, spoken and taught everywhere. Brogues
          and dialects are widespread in rural areas, however, and many people
          tend to conserve their regional linguistic customs either through
          tradition or through a voluntary and deliberate return to a specific
          regional dialect. This tendency is strongest in the frontier areas of
          France. In the eastern and northern part of the country, Alsatian and
          Flemish (Dutch) are Germanic languages; in the south, Occitan
          (Provençal or Languedoc), Corsican, and Catalan show the influence of
          Latin. Breton is a Celtic language related to languages spoken in some
          western parts of the British Isles (notably Wales), and Basque is a
          language isolate. Following the introduction of universal primary
          education during the Third Republic in 1872, the use of regional
          languages was rigorously repressed in the interest of national unity,
          and pupils using them were punished. More recently, in reaction to the
          rise in regional sentiment, these languages have been introduced in a
          number of schools and universities, primarily because some of them,
          such as Occitan, Basque, and Breton, have maintained a literary
          tradition. Recent immigration has introduced various non-European
          languages, notably Arabic.

          About three-fifths of the French people belong to the Roman Catholic
          Church. Only a minority, however, regularly participate in religious
          worship; practice is greatest among the middle classes. The northwest
          (Brittany-Vendée), the east (Lorraine, Vosges, Alsace, Jura, Lyonnais,
          and the northern Alps), the north (Flanders), the Basque Country, and
          the region south of the Massif Central have a higher percentage of
          practicing Roman Catholics than the rest of the country. Recruitment
          of priests has become more difficult, even though the church,
          historically autonomous, is very progressive and ecumenical.
