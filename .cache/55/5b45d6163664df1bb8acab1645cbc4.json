Historically and culturally\n          among the most important nations in the Western world, France has also\n          played a highly significant role in international affairs, with former\n          colonies in every corner of the globe. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean\n          and the Mediterranean Sea, the Alps and the Pyrenees, France has long\n          provided a geographic, economic, and linguistic bridge joining\n          northern and southern Europe. It is Europe’s most important\n          agricultural producer and one of the world’s leading industrial\n          powers.\"\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The graph shows the groups of men of different age\n          (20 to 79 years) of French nationality.

Before the official discovery of the Americas at\n          the end of the 15th century, France, located on the western extremity\n          of the Old World, was regarded for centuries by Europeans as being\n          near the edge of the known world. Generations of different migrants\n          traveling by way of the Mediterranean from the Middle East and Africa\n          and through Europe from Central Asia and the Nordic lands settled\n          permanently in France, forming a variegated grouping, almost like a\n          series of geologic strata, since they were unable to migrate any\n          farther. Perhaps the oldest reflection of these migrations is\n          furnished by the Basque people, who live in an isolated area west of\n          the Pyrenees in both Spain and France, who speak a language unrelated\n          to other European languages, and whose origin remains unclear. The\n          Celtic tribes, known to the Romans as Gauls, spread from central\n          Europe in the period 500 BCE–500 CE to provide France with a major\n          component of its population, especially in the centre and west. At the\n          fall of the Roman Empire, there was a powerful penetration of Germanic\n          (Teutonic) peoples, especially in northern and eastern France. The\n          incursion of the Norsemen (Vikings) brought further Germanic\n          influence. In addition to these many migrations, France was, over the\n          centuries, the field of numerous battles and of prolonged occupations\n          before becoming, in the 19th and especially in the 20th century, the\n          prime recipient of foreign immigration into Europe, adding still other\n          mixtures to the ethnic melting pot.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          French is the national language, spoken and taught everywhere. Brogues\n          and dialects are widespread in rural areas, however, and many people\n          tend to conserve their regional linguistic customs either through\n          tradition or through a voluntary and deliberate return to a specific\n          regional dialect. This tendency is strongest in the frontier areas of\n          France. In the eastern and northern part of the country, Alsatian and\n          Flemish (Dutch) are Germanic languages; in the south, Occitan\n          (Provençal or Languedoc), Corsican, and Catalan show the influence of\n          Latin. Breton is a Celtic language related to languages spoken in some\n          western parts of the British Isles (notably Wales), and Basque is a\n          language isolate. Following the introduction of universal primary\n          education during the Third Republic in 1872, the use of regional\n          languages was rigorously repressed in the interest of national unity,\n          and pupils using them were punished. More recently, in reaction to the\n          rise in regional sentiment, these languages have been introduced in a\n          number of schools and universities, primarily because some of them,\n          such as Occitan, Basque, and Breton, have maintained a literary\n          tradition. Recent immigration has introduced various non-European\n          languages, notably Arabic.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          About three-fifths of the French people belong to the Roman Catholic\n          Church. Only a minority, however, regularly participate in religious\n          worship; practice is greatest among the middle classes. The northwest\n          (Brittany-Vendée), the east (Lorraine, Vosges, Alsace, Jura, Lyonnais,\n          and the northern Alps), the north (Flanders), the Basque Country, and\n          the region south of the Massif Central have a higher percentage of\n          practicing Roman Catholics than the rest of the country. Recruitment\n          of priests has become more difficult, even though the church,\n          historically autonomous, is very progressive and ecumenical.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=\"/e8a233058211c77f51de535cd8ebb8d6.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"b92bf829a4929316b309bdebf8a5caa3","cacheData":{}}
