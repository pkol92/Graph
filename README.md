# Graph from api
The project shows a page that retrieved data (1000 records containing information about men of French nationality) from the external API (https://randomuser.me/). 
The graph shows the groups of men of different age (20 to 79 years).
The table shows basic information about the 10 oldest males from the available data. 
The loader appears while the data is being loaded. 
Additionally, every fifth refresh of the page shows an image (French flag) in the second section of the text.
The code was written in JS, the chart was made with the chart.js library.
