# Graph from api
The project shows a page that retrieved data (1000 records containing information about men of French nationality) from the external API (https://randomuser.me/). 
<br>The graph shows the groups of men of different age (20 to 79 years).
<br>The table shows basic information about the 10 oldest males from the available data. 
<br>The loader appears while the data is being loaded. 
<br>Additionally, every fifth refresh of the page shows an image (French flag) in the second section of the text.
<br>The code was written in JS, the chart was made with the chart.js library.
